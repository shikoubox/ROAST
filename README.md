DTU Roadrunners Solar Team

Code and source files for all Solar Car parts and other related files. (e.g. PCBs, 3D prints, Embedded, Project materials, datasheets and literature)

# Structure
For parts, put all relevant for your part/project in a corresponding parts folder with, part and year.
For files that are larger than 100 MB, please upload them to OneDrive instead, and leave a link if relevant in this repository.

# CAD
All CAD is done in Solidworks.
Please provide technical drawings in .pdf, to avoid need for SolidWorks.

# Circuit Boards
All PCB design is done in KiCad.
There are old projects done in Eagle, but Autodesk has killed the Eagle.
Please provide schematics in .pdf, to avoid need for KiCad or Eagle, to see the circuit/board layout.

Also, both pdf, project, and silkscreen needs a tag with appropriate PCB title, date, revision no., and who made it (e.g. study number).
